## Docker

- image: is a template that defines how to build a container, including the application code, dependencies, and configuration
- container: is a running instance of image. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, and provide a consistent runtime environment for the application
- snapshot: 
- volume:
  - to share data between containers, and between containers and the host system.
  - data in volume is not lost if containers are stopped or deleted.
  - can be used to store sensitive data, such as credentials or configuration files, outside of the container's file system, improving security and reducing the risk of data breaches.
